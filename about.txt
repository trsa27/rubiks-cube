this is a rubic's cube simulator. With every face of the cube coordinated
into center, north, east, south, west...(NE, SE, SW, NW), and using char to represent the color code,  we can then "hard-code" the transformations of the cube.


TODO: 
    1.  complete the whole commend process at rc_CMD.h <DONE>
    2.  transform this rubic's cube code into a encoding method , simulat to the idea of enigma
